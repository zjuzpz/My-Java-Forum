This is a full stack Java web application. <br>
Like all forums, you can search, reply or post topics in my Java forum. And if you are logged-in as an administrator, you can also modify or delete the post.<br>
I used JSP, HTML and JavaScript to present the web at the front-end and used Java, MySQL and Tomcat Server to manage the data at the back-end. <br>
The front-end web page is partily copied from https://www.java.net/forums. Thus there are some redundant codes in .jsp files. <br>
This is a web project mainly for practicing, thus there are lots of functionalities for a normal forum have not been realized yet.<br>
The BBS1.5.avi file shows some realized functionalities.<br>
Thanks!
